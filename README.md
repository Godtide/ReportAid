## Usage

Below describes a demo' of **ReportAid**.

## Demo


![](/docs/paper/images/reportaidWriteSector.png)

A demo of **ReportAid** is running on [dat](https://dat.foundation/). 

Below explains the dependencies that must be fulfilled before you can load [dat](https://dat.foundation/) instances of **ReportAid**.

### Demo Dependencies

The [dat](https://dat.foundation/) instance of **ReportAid** requires the [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/) browser with the [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) extension. The smart contracts of **ReportAid** are running on the [Rinkeby Ethereum Testnet](https://www.rinkeby.io/); hence, for **ReportAid** to interact with those, [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) should be pointing at [Rinkeby](https://www.rinkeby.io/). You will need a few test Ether in your [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) wallet, which you can get from the [Rinkeby Faucet](https://faucet.rinkeby.io/). Those test Ether will allow you to sign the transactions necessary to create [IATI Standard](https://iatistandard.org/en/) records that **ReportAid**  supports.

#### DAT

In addition to [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/), you will also need the [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/) [DAT P2P Protocol](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/dat-p2p-protocol/) extension installed. Ensure [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) is pointing at [Rinkeby](https://www.rinkeby.io/), then load the following URL: http://4b1bdf7b0f6beeadab5dadaf019cddbc94f618792ea30b8a2f5d957267d5bd92/

**ReportAid** is an early proof of concept, so apologies in advance - help for using the app' is currently 'minimal', at best. You should expect some bugs, too (if you find any, feel free to raise an [issue](https://github.com/glowkeeper/ReportAid/issues)). Furthermore, the app' is missing some functionality as it does not, currently, implement all of the [IATI Standard](https://iatistandard.org/en/). That said, as a proof of concept, the app' serves its purpose well. Hopefully, you agree and want to get involved - if so, please get in touch with s dot huckle at sussex dot ac dot uk.

## Built Using

- [node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [Ganache](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache)
- [Truffle](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) + [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) + [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/)

## Install

The instruction below enable you to run **ReportAid** on a local, private, Ethereum test network (via [Ganache](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache)). Before following the instructions below, please install the [dependencies](#dependencies).

Follow the instructions in the [Ganache](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache) repository for downloading and installing Ganache; tl;dr - you need to clone the [Ganache](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache) repository, then run `npm install && npm start`.

In the **ReportAid** repository's [/app](/app) directory, type `npm install`. That should install everything listed in [package.json](/app/package.json), which form the components of the REACT-based web frontend to this application.

Now, publish the contracts to your local blockchain (via [Ganache](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache)):

1. Change directory to the [Ganache](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache) repository.
2. Start [Ganache](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache) by typing `npm start`.
3. Ensure [Ganache](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache) is running on [http://localhost:8545](http://localhost:8545) (you may need to change its settings to do so).
4. Change to the **ReportAid** repository's [/app](/app) directory.
5. Build the **ReportAid** smart contracts by running `npm run generate`.
6. Deploy the **ReportAid** smart contracts by running `npm run develMigrate`.
6. Edit the **ReportAid** config file [/app/src/app/utils/config.ts](/app/src/app/utils/config.ts) so that the contract static variables contain the addresses generated by `npm run develMigrate`, above.

Now create the web application:

1. Build the REACT frontend by typing `npm run compile` (you can also watch for any changes by running `npm run watch`).
2. Startup an instance of [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) by typing `npm run start`.

Then fire up a [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/) browser and go to the URL [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081). You must have the [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/) extension [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) installed. [Ganache](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache) will have generated some test addresses with 100 test Ether that will allow you to sign the transactions necessary to create [IATI Standard](https://iatistandard.org/en/) records that update the blockchain. You need to import one of those addresses' private keys into [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/).
