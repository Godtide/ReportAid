This is the repository of **ReportAid** - a tool for reporting on humanitarian aid. **ReportAid** is a blockchain implementation of the [IATI Standard](https://iatistandard.org/en/).

A live demo' of [ReportAid](http://4b1bdf7b0f6beeadab5dadaf019cddbc94f618792ea30b8a2f5d957267d5bd92/) is running on the [Rinkeby Ethereum Testnet](https://www.rinkeby.io/) at http://4b1bdf7b0f6beeadab5dadaf019cddbc94f618792ea30b8a2f5d957267d5bd92/. To see the demo' (and use it), you will need to be running [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/) with the [DAT P2P Protocol](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/dat-p2p-protocol/) and [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) extensions installed. You will also need a few test Ether in your [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) wallet, which you can get from the [Rinkeby Faucet](https://faucet.rinkeby.io/).

Relevant works are in the [docs](/docs) subdirectory.

The idea for the DSR artefact [ReportAid](https://github.com/glowkeeper/ReportAid) came from a University of Sussex Masters Student studying within the Science Policy Research Unit (SPRU), who intended to explore humanitarian blockchains as a means of entering SPRU's 2018 Science, Technology and Innovation Policy Challenge. However, she wanted to present blockchains as a novel means of providing finance during a humanitarian crisis, which is a laudable aim, but not something the author thought viable, currently. Instead, the author could see the immediate benefit of a blockchain-based tool that could deliver trustworthy aid reports, rather than providing aid directly. Therefore, a much more practical and immediately realisable aim would be to produce a blockchain implementation of the IATI standard for enhancing humanitarian aid reporting [@WorldHumanitarianSummit_CommitmentsActionWorld_2016]. As a result, [ReportAid](https://github.com/glowkeeper/ReportAid), a blockchain-based PoC for reporting on humanitarian aid, came into being.
