# SPRU Science, Technology and Innovation Policy Challenge

This document lists the criteria for success in SPRU's [Science, Technology and Innovation Policy Challenge](http://www.sussex.ac.uk/spru/study/stichallenge).

## Challenge Scope

1. The idea must relate to SPRUâ€™s broad research interests in science, technology and/or innovation. This would cover obvious areas such as science, research and innovation policies and policies involved in the regulation of scientific developments but it could also cover a much wider array of policy areas such as environmental and energy policies and industrial strategy policies.

2. The policy idea must relate to policy ideas only and not to ideas for new technological, product or process innovations. Although, of course, the policy proposal could involve the use of technology in some way. For example, a proposal for the development of an innovative smartphone app on its own would not be accepted but a policy proposal for a public-sector organisation which utilises a particular app to improve public services would be.  

3. The proposal must relate to public policy rather than to individual company strategies or management proposals.

## Judging Criteria

Judges will be asked to identify the proposal with the most potential to address a significant policy issue, taking into account:

1. Creativity and originality of thinking
2. Evidence that participants have considered the perspective of the policy maker and what the barriers to implementation of the policy could be and ways to overcome them
3. How engaging the style of communication is. Judges will be looking for a style that grabs and hold attention
4. Clarity of communication. Judges will be looking for a style of communication that is easy to follow and uses language that is widely understandable
