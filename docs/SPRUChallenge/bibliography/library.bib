By considering intelligent buildings in the spirit of built heritage conservation, future architectural and construction efforts can contribute toward emergence of durable buildings that are meant to enhance sustainability in the built environment. The promotion of intelligent and green technologies should be educational in nature, reaching out to a wide range of parties and allowing them to participate in the progress of the technologies. We propose an initiative to promote this process. We also examine two case studies of existing demonstration projects.},

  shorttitle = {Life Cycle Energy Analysis of Buildings},
  abstract = {Buildings demand energy in their life cycle right from its construction to demolition. Studies on the total energy use during the life cycle are desirable to identify phases of largest energy use and to develop strategies for its reduction. In the present paper, a critical review of the life cycle energy analyses of buildings resulting from 73 cases across 13 countries is presented. The study includes both residential and office buildings. Results show that operating (80-90\%) and embodied (10-20\%) phases of energy use are significant contributors to building's life cycle energy demand. Life cycle energy (primary) requirement of conventional residential buildings falls in the range of 150-400 kWh/m2 per year and that of office buildings in the range of 250-550 kWh/m2 per year. Building's life cycle energy demand can be reduced by reducing its operating energy significantly through use of passive and active technologies even if it leads to a slight increase in embodied energy. However, an excessive use of passive and active features in a building may be counterproductive. It is observed that low energy buildings perform better than self-sufficient (zero operating energy) buildings in the life cycle context. Since, most of the case studies available in open literature pertain to developed and/or cold countries; hence, energy indicative figures for developing and/or non-cold countries need to be evaluated and compared with the results presented in this paper.},

  abstract = {Various reports have shown that cannabinoids (the active components of marijuana and their derivatives) can reduce tumour growth and progression in animal models of cancer, in addition to their well-known palliative effects on some cancer-associated symptoms. This Opinion article discusses our current understanding of cannabinoids as antitumour agents, focusing on recent insights into the molecular mechanisms of action, including emerging resistance mechanisms and opportunities for combination therapy approaches. Such knowledge is required for the optimization of preclinical cannabinoid-based therapies and for the preliminary clinical testing that is currently underway.},

  shorttitle = {What {{Is Stochastic Resonance}}?},
  abstract = {Stochastic resonance is said to be observed when increases in levels of unpredictable fluctuations—e.g., random noise—cause an increase in a metric of the quality of signal transmission or detection performance, rather than a decrease. This counterintuitive effect relies on system nonlinearities and on some parameter ranges being “suboptimal”. Stochastic resonance has been observed, quantified, and described in a plethora of physical and biological systems, including neurons. Being a topic of widespread multidisciplinary interest, the definition of stochastic resonance has evolved significantly over the last decade or so, leading to a number of debates, misunderstandings, and controversies. Perhaps the most important debate is whether the brain has evolved to utilize random noise in vivo, as part of the “neural code”. Surprisingly, this debate has been for the most part ignored by neuroscientists, despite much indirect evidence of a positive role for noise in the brain. We explore some of the reasons for this and argue why it would be more surprising if the brain did not exploit randomness provided by noise—via stochastic resonance or otherwise—than if it did. We also challenge neuroscientists and biologists, both computational and experimental, to embrace a very broad definition of stochastic resonance in terms of signal-processing “noise benefits”, and to devise experiments aimed at verifying that random variability can play a functional role in the brain, nervous system, or other areas of biology.},

The equation arises in the theory of the climate of the earth. We find that the cooperative effect of the stochastic perturbation and periodic forcing lead to an amplification of the peak of the power spectrum, due to a mechanism that we call stochastic resonance. A heuristic analysis of the resonance condition is presented and our analytical findings are confirmed by numerical calculations.$<$/p$>$},

  abstract = {Buildings nowadays are increasingly expected to meet higher and more complex performance requirements: they should be sustainable; use zero-net energy; foster a healthy and comfortable environment for the occupants; be grid-friendly, yet economical to build and maintain. The essential ingredients for the successful development and operation of net zero- and positive-energy buildings (NZEB/PEB) are: thermal simulation models, that are accurate representations of the building and its subsystems; sensors, actuators, and user interfaces to facilitate communication between the physical and simulation layers; and finally, integrated control and optimization tools of sufficient generality that using the sensor inputs and the thermal models can take intelligent decisions, in almost real-time, regarding the operation of the building and its subsystems. To this end the aim of the present paper is to present a review on the technological developments in each of the essential ingredients that may support the future integration of successful NZEB/PEB, i.e. accurate simulation models, sensors and actuators and last but not least the building optimization and control. The integration of the user is an integral part in the dynamic behavior of the system, and this role has to be taken into account. Future prospects and research trends are discussed.},

It is argued that these three theories offer related perspectives on the shortcomings of positivism as well as new ways to theorize and study contemporary societies. Empirical and conceptual applications of these perspectives in sociological research are discussed. Some of these applications include work in the sociology of deviance, gender, media and culture. Finally, implications of these three theoretical perspectives for the ways sociologists think about the boundaries and territoriality of their discipline are discussed.},

  abstract = {Photoexcited states of three Rh(III) 5,10,15-tris(pentafluorophenyl)corroles coordinated by different axial ligands; namely, triphenylphosphine P(C(6)H(5))(3) group (1), pyridine C(6)H(5)N group (2), and two pyridine groups (3) were studied by X- and Q-band time-resolved electron paramagnetic resonance (TREPR) in frozen toluene and liquid crystal E-7. Transient mutations were utilized to identify multiplicity of the detected paramagnetic species. The spectra of 1 and 2 were assigned to triplet ((3)pipi*) states, while contributions of triplet ((3)dd and charge transfer (3)CT) and quintet ((5)dd) states were revealed in the spectrum of 3. The results are interpreted in terms of a peculiar nature of transition metal complexes with the unfilled d-shell, where close lying electronic states of different multiplicities may be mixed through configurational, spin-orbit, and vibronic coupling. From the EPR spectra, the spin-orbit coupling constant was estimated to be about 25 cm(-1). It is shown that different axial ligation of complexes shifts the relative energy of the excited states and, consequently, leads to population of different states. Plausible explanations of the effects governing unusual spectral and dynamic parameters of the photoexcited Rh corrole complexes are presented.},

  abstract = {Dendritic cell (DC) vaccination is emerging as a promising therapeutic option for malignant glioma patients. However, the optimal antigen formulation for loading these cells has yet to be established. The objective of this study was to compare the safety, feasibility, and immune responses of malignant glioma patients on 2 different DC vaccination protocols. Twenty-eight patients were treated with autologous tumor lysate (ATL)-pulsed DC vaccination, whereas 6 patients were treated with glioma-associated antigen (GAA) peptide-pulsed DCs. Safety, toxicity, feasibility, and correlative immune monitoring assay results were compared between patients on each trial. Because of HLA subtype restrictions on the GAA-DC trial, 6/15 screened patients were eligible for treatment, whereas 28/32 patients passed eligibility screening for the ATL-DC trial. Elevated frequencies of activated natural killer cells were observed in the peripheral blood from GAA-DC patients compared with the ATL-DC patients. In addition, a significant correlation was observed between decreased regulatory T lymphocyte (Treg) ratios (postvaccination/prevaccination) and overall survival (P=0.004) in patients on both trials. In fact, Treg ratios were independently prognostic for overall survival in these patients, whereas tumor pathology was not in multivariate analyses. In conclusion, these results suggest that ATL-DC vaccination is associated with wider patient eligibility compared with GAA-DC vaccination. Decreased postvaccination/prevaccination Treg ratios and decreased frequencies of activated natural killer cells were associated with prolonged survival in patients from both trials, suggesting that these lymphocyte subsets may be relevant immune monitoring endpoints for immunotherapy protocols in malignant glioma patients.},

  abstract = {A comprehensive case study life cycle assessment (LCA) was conducted of a 7300 m2, six-story building with a projected 75 year life span, located on the University of Michigan campus. The bottom three floors and basement are used as classrooms and open-plan offices; the top three floors are used as hotel rooms. An inventory of all installed materials and material replacements was conducted covering the building structure, envelope, interior structure and finishes, as well as the utility and sanitary systems. Computer modeling was used to determine primary energy consumption for heating, cooling, ventilation, lighting, hot water and sanitary water consumption. Demolition and other end-of-life burdens were also inventoried.
The primary energy intensity over the building's life cycle is estimated to be 2.3×106 GJ, or 316 GJ/m2. Production of building materials, their transportation to the site as well as the construction of the building accounts for 2.2\% of life cycle primary energy consumption. HVAC and electricity account for 94.4\% of life cycle primary energy consumption. Water services account for 3.3\% of life cycle primary energy consumption, with water heating being the major factor, due to the presence of hotel rooms in this building. Building demolition and transportation of waste, accounts for only 0.2\% of life cycle primary energy consumption.
All impact categories measured (global warming potential, ozone depletion potential, acidification potential, nutrification potential and solid waste generation) correlate closely with primary energy demand.
The challenges in developing a life cycle model of a complex dynamic system with a long service life are explored and the implications for future designs are discussed.},

  abstract = {1. The steady-state kinetics of the interconversion of CO2 and HCO3 catalyzed by human carbonic anhydrase C was studied using 1H2O and 2H2O as solvents. The pH-independent parts of the parameters k(cat) and Km are 3-4 times larger in 1H2O than in 2H2O for both directions of the reaction, while the ratios k(cat)/Km show much smaller isotope effects. With either CO2 or HCO3 as substrate the major pH dependence is observed in k(cat), while Km appears independent of pH. The pKa value characterizing the pH-rate profiles is approximately 0.5 unit larger in 2H2O than in 1H2O. 2. The hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl acetate catalyzed by human carbonic anhudrase C is approximately 35\% faster in 2H2O than in 1H2O. In both solvents the pKa values of the pH-rate profiles are similar to those observed for the CO2-HCO3 interconversion. 3. It is tentatively proposed that the rate-limiting step at saturating concentrations of CO2 or HCO3 is an intramolecular proton transfer between two ionizing groups in the active site. It cannot be decided whether the transformation between enzyme-bound CO2 and HCO3 involves a proton trnasfer or not.},

  doi = {10.1136/adc.2009.162057},
  shorttitle = {The Diagnosis of Brain Tumours in Children},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND

Brain tumours are the commonest solid tumour in children. Children with brain tumours are frequently unwell for months prior to diagnosis. A prolonged period between symptom onset and diagnosis is associated with increased morbidity.

OBJECTIVE

To develop an evidence-based clinical guideline to support healthcare professionals in the identification, assessment and investigation of children presenting with symptoms and signs that could be due to a brain tumour.

METHODS

A systematic literature review with a meta-analysis and cohort study provided the guideline evidence base. A multi-disciplinary workshop and Delphi consensus voting were used to translate the evidence into a clinical guideline. The results of the literature review and cohort study have been previously published.

RESULTS

20 healthcare professionals and parents participated in the workshop. 77 statements were generated detailing the presenting features of childhood brain tumours, factors that could be used to discriminate brain tumours from other less serious conditions and possible referral pathways for children with brain tumours. 156 healthcare professionals agreed to participate in the Delphi process; 112 completed the first round and 88 completed all three rounds (attrition rate 21\%). 64 statements reached consensus. The final guideline comprises 76 recommendations advising on the symptomatology of childhood brain tumours, assessment of children who may have a brain tumour and recommendations for selection for and timing of central nervous system imaging.

CONCLUSION

Implementation of this guideline may support clinicians in the identification and timely imaging of children with brain tumours. This may reduce the morbidity currently experienced by many children with brain tumours.},

A total of 326 children (mean age = 10.4 years) took part in three data-collection waves, one before and two after the switch-over of the airports. After the switch, long-term memory and reading were impaired in the noise group at the new airport. and improved in the formerly noise-exposed group at the old airport. Short-term memory also improved in the latter group after the old airport was closed. At the new airport, speech perception was impaired in the newly noise-exposed group. Mediational analyses suggest that poorer reading was not mediated by speech perception, and that impaired recall was in part mediated by reading.},

This is true for Marx's theory of value, his rejection of Ricardo's interpretation of Say's Law, his treatment of the realization problem in the schemes of reproduction and his theories of credit and the rate of interest. The implications of this monetary interpretation for Marx's theory of distribution and growth display broad similarities to a monetary extension of a Kaleckian version of the post-Keynesian model, in which the equilibrium growth path is determined by the interaction between monetary and real variables.},

  abstract = {Starting from Schumpeter's important distinction between ‘real analysis’ and ‘monetary analysis’, in this paper it is shown that major elements of Marx's economic theory fall in the camp of ‘monetary analysis’. This is true for Marx's theory of value, his rejection of Ricardo's interpretation of Say's Law, his treatment of the realization problem in the schemes of reproduction and his theories of credit and the rate of interest. The implications of this monetary interpretation for Marx's theory of distribution and growth display broad similarities to a monetary extension of a Kaleckian version of the post-Keynesian model, in which the equilibrium growth path is determined by the interaction between monetary and real variables.},

  abstract = {The construction industry is a major waste generator and consumer of natural resources. The importance of changing traditionally adopted attitudes (such as the discard of used materials components for recycling and reuse practices) in order to create a more sustainable production model is presented in the literature. The aim of this exploratory paper is to analyze major social, economical and legal factors, which can act as barriers or opportunities in the reuse of building components. The research strategy employed is a single-embedded case study. The main unit of analysis is the reuse process, investigated by the study of the demolition sector in the city of Porto Alegre (Brazil). The process is characterized; its main phases and agents are presented and described. The supply chain management (SCM) approach is used to model the reuse process. The article summarizes major factors, which influence the reuse process, pointed in the literature and compares those with the case study findings enabling the identification of some differences. The case study findings suggest that the reuse of building components is primarily supported by economical and social aspects such as the labor cost of deconstruction and demand for reused products. Although legal mechanisms may play an important role in promoting the reuse of building components, its potential was not observed in the case study. The article also provides a critical analysis of the current state of construction waste management in Porto Alegre on issues like legislation and responsibilities, considering recent changes in national regulations. Finally, the adoption of the SCM approach has showed to be useful for the analysis of "close loop" supply chains as it enabled the identification of additional factors that can influence the reuse process.},

In the present review, the potential of targeting the cannabinoid system for the treatment of cancer is considered from a practical, rather than a mechanistic viewpoint, addressing questions such as whether human tumour cells express CB receptors; whether the potencies of action of cannabinoids in vitro match the potencies expected on the base of receptor theory; what is known about the in vivo effects of cannabinoids and cancer, and how relevant the experiments undertaken are to the clinical situation; and finally, what approaches can be taken to minimise unwanted effects of cannabinoid treatment. It is concluded that cannabinoids (or agents modulating the endogenous cannabinoid system) are an attractive target for drug development in the cancer area, but that more in vivo studies, particularly those investigating the potential of cannabinoids as an addition to current treatment strategies, are needed.},

  volume = {100},
  issn = {1460-2105},
  doi = {10.1093/jnci/djm268},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cannabinoids, in addition to having palliative benefits in cancer therapy, have been associated with anticarcinogenic effects. Although the antiproliferative activities of cannabinoids have been intensively investigated, little is known about their effects on tumor invasion.
METHODS: Matrigel-coated and uncoated Boyden chambers were used to quantify invasiveness and migration, respectively, of human cervical cancer (HeLa) cells that had been treated with cannabinoids (the stable anandamide analog R(+)-methanandamide [MA] and the phytocannabinoid delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol [THC]) in the presence or absence of antagonists of the CB1 or CB2 cannabinoid receptors or of transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) or inhibitors of p38 or p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunoblotting were used to assess the influence of cannabinoids on the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and endogenous tissue inhibitors of MMPs (TIMPs). The role of TIMP-1 in the anti-invasive action of cannabinoids was analyzed by transfecting HeLa, human cervical carcinoma (C33A), or human lung carcinoma cells (A549) cells with siRNA targeting TIMP-1. All statistical tests were two-sided.
RESULTS: Without modifying migration, MA and THC caused a time- and concentration-dependent suppression of HeLa cell invasion through Matrigel that was accompanied by increased expression of TIMP-1. At the lowest concentrations tested, MA (0.1 microM) and THC (0.01 microM) led to a decrease in invasion (normalized to that observed with vehicle-treated cells) of 61.5\% (95\% CI = 38.7\% to 84.3\%, P $<$ .001) and 68.1\% (95\% CI = 31.5\% to 104.8\%, P = .0039), respectively. The stimulation of TIMP-1 expression and suppression of cell invasion were reversed by pretreatment of cells with antagonists to CB1 or CB2 receptors, with inhibitors of MAPKs, or, in the case of MA, with an antagonist to TRPV1. Knockdown of cannabinoid-induced TIMP-1 expression by siRNA led to a reversal of the cannabinoid-elicited decrease in tumor cell invasiveness in HeLa, A549, and C33A cells.
CONCLUSION: Increased expression of TIMP-1 mediates an anti-invasive effect of cannabinoids. Cannabinoids may therefore offer a therapeutic option in the treatment of highly invasive cancers.},

In particular, this tool can support the designer in the choice of the product with an higher recyclability potential from a set of different alternatives. The model takes into consideration a Multi-Attribute Decision-Making method and allows calculating a "Global Recycling Index" (GRI) starting from a set of energy, environmental, technical and economic indicators. A weight is assigned to each parameter following the experience of the designer; a sensitivity analysis is then performed to state how the different assumptions can affect the final results. The model is implemented in a software and applied to a case study: to establish the best recyclability option of middle and low voltage electrical lines used for electricity distribution in Italy.},

  abstract = {Several immunostimulant approaches have been studied in the treatment of gliomas. The advent of recombinant DNA technology led to a nonspecific immunostimulation via systemic administration of cytokines. Recently, in attempts to more closely mimic their natural activity, cytokines have been delivered by implanting genetically transduced cells or by using in vivo gene transfer techniques. The latest efforts have focused on immunostimulatory agents that act directly on antigen-presenting cells and effector cells of the immune system via pattern recognition receptors. Combining these strategies with more than one mode of immunotherapy may provide better clinical results.},

  shorttitle = {Anarchism},
  abstract = {To what degree can anarchism be an effective organized movement? Is it realistic to think of anarchist ideas ever forming the basis for social life itself? These questions are widely being asked again today in response to the forces of economic globalization. The framework for such discussions was perhaps given its most memorable shape, however, in George Woodcockʼs classic study of anarchism-first published in the 1960s, revised in 1986 and now widely recognized as the most significant twentieth-century overview of the subject. Woodcock surveys all of the major figures that shaped anarchist thought, from Godwin and Proudhon to Bakunin, Goldman, and Kropotkin, and looks as well at the long-term prospects for anarchism and anarchist thought. In Woodcockʼs view ʺpureʺ anarchism-characterized by ʺthe loose and flexible affinity group which needs no formal organizationʺ-was incompatible with mass movements that require stable organizations, that are forced to make compromises in the face of changing circumstances, and that need to maintain the allegiance of a wide range of supporters. Yet Woodcock continued to cherish anarchist ideals; as he said in a 1990 interview, ʺI think anarchism and its teachings of decentralization, of the coordination of rural and industrial societies, and of mutual aid as the foundation of any viable society, have lessons that in the present are especially applicable to industrial societies.ʺ Also includes information on anarcho-syndicalism, Michael Bakunin, Bakuninism, Louis-Auguste Blanqui, Blanquism, Paul Brousse, Carlo Cafiero, Guiseppe Fanelli, Sebastien Faure, Mohandas Gandhi, Giuseppe Garibaldi, William Godwin, Emma Goldman, James Guillaume, Peter Kropotkin, Errico Malatesta, Karl Marx, Marxism, Guiseppe Mazzini, William Morris, pacifism, Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, Elisee Reclus, Spanish Civil War, Max Stirner, Leo Tolstoy, utopias and utopianism, Gerrard Winstanley, etc.},

  title = {A Competitive Labeling Method for the Determination of the Chemical Properties of Solitary Functional Groups in Proteins},
  volume = {14},
  issn = {0006-2960},
  abstract = {The properties of the functional groups in a protein can be used as built-in-probes of the structure of the protein. We have developed a general procedure whereby the ionization constant and chemical reactivity of solitary functional groups in proteins may be determined. The method may be applied to the side chain of histidine, tyrosine, lysine, and cysteine, as well as to the amino terminus of the protein. The method, which is an extension of the competitive labeling technique using [3H]- and [14C]1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (N2ph-F) in a double-labeling procedure, is rapid and sensitive. Advantage is taken of the fact that after acid hydrolysis of a dinitrophenylated protein, a derivative is obtained which must be derived from a unique position in the protein. The method has been applied to the solitary histidine residue of lysozyme, alpha-lytic protease, and Streptomyces griseus (S.G.) trypsin, as well as to the amino terminus of the latter protein. The following parameters were obtained for reaction with N2ph-F at 20 degrees C in 0.1 N KCl: the histidine of hen egg-white lysozyme, pKa of 6.4 and second-order velocity constant of 0.188 M-1 min-1; the histidine of alpha-lytic protease, pKa of 6.5 and second-order velocity constant of 0.0235 M-1 min-1; the histidine of S.G. trypsin, pKa of 6.5 and second-order velocity constant of 0.0328 M-1 min-1; the valyl amino terminus of S.G. trypsin, pKa of 8.1 and second-order velocity constant of 0.403 M-1 min-1. In addition, the results obtained provide clues as to the microenvironments of these functional groups, and indicate that the proteins studied undergo pH-dependent conformational changes which affect the microenvironment, and hence the chemical reactivity of these groups.},

Regional myocardial blood flow was determined by means of the particle distribution method. In normoxia a transmural gradient of flow was observed, with the subendocardial layers receiving a significantly higher flow rate compared with the subepicardial layers. In hypoxia induced vasodilation this transmural gradient of flow was persistent. In contrast a marked redistribution of regional flow was observed under pharmacologically induced vasodilation. The transmural gradient decreased. In contrast to some findings these experiments demonstrate that a considerable vasodilatory capacity exists in all layers of the myocardium and can be utilized by drugs. The differences observed for the intramural distribution pattern of flow under hypoxia and drug induced vasodilation support the hypothesis that this pattern reflects corresponding gradients of regional myocardial metabolism.},

The problem with this version of history' There's not a shred of evidence to support it. Here anthropologist David Graeber presents a stunning reversal of conventional wisdom. He shows that for more than 5,000 years, since the beginnings of the first agrarian empires, humans have used elaborate credit systems to buy and sell goods'that is, long before the invention of coins or cash. It is in this era, Graeber argues, that we also first encounter a society divided into debtors and creditors. Graeber shows that arguments about debt and debt forgiveness have been at the center of political debates from Italy to China, as well as sparking innumerable insurrections. He also brilliantly demonstrates that the language of the ancient works of law and religion (words like "guilt," "sin," and "redemption") derive in large part from ancient debates about debt, and shape even our most basic ideas of right and wrong. We are still fighting these battles today without knowing it. Debt: The First 5,000 Years is a fascinating chronicle of this little known history'as well as how it has defined human history, and what it means for the credit crisis of the present day and the future of our economy.

To some, sharing constitutes piracy, to be fought against and eradicated. Others see it as unavoidable, and table proposals to compensate for its harmful effects. Meanwhile, little progress has been made towards addressing the real challenges facing culture in a digital world. Sharing starts from a radically different viewpoint, namely that the non-market sharing of digital works is both legitimate and useful. It supports this premise with empirical research, demonstrating that non-market sharing leads to more diversity in the attention given to various works. Taking stock of what we have learnt about the cultural economy in recent years, Sharing sets out the conditions necessary for valuable cultural functions to remain sustainable in this context."--Page 4 of cover},

In it we talk about the history, trends, technology ecosystem and the future of the Internet of Things, Connected Cities, Connected Homes, Connected Health and Connected Cars. We also discuss the most promising areas for entrepreneurs and venture investors. We share exciting stories and unique opinions of over 30 industry veterans, experts and visionaries from Google, Ericcson, AT \& T, Qualcomm, Accenture, SAP, MIT, EcoLife Foundation and many others. We called this book The Silent Intelligence because most of the activity and growth in the space has so far been happening outside of mainstream visibility. We hope that our book will help executives, entrepreneurs, investors and everybody else better understand the opportunities and challenges of the Internet of Things and will get them as excited about the upcoming possibilities as we are."--Pub. desc.},

What is Bitcoin Mining Difficulty?

Visualize and Download High-Resolution Infographic
The Computationally-Difficult Problem
Bitcoin mining a block is difficult because the SHA-256 hash of a block's header must be lower than or equal to the target in order for the block to be accepted by the network.
This problem can be simplified for explanation purposes: The hash of a block must start with a certain number of zeros. The probability of calculating a hash that starts with many zeros is very low, therefore many attempts must be made. In order to generate a new hash each round, a nonce is incremented. This is based on the hashcash function.
The Bitcoin Network Difficulty Metric
The Bitcoin network difficulty is the measure of how difficult it is to find a new block compared to the easiest it can ever be. It is recalculated every 2016 blocks to a value such that the previous 2016 blocks would have been generated in exactly two weeks had everyone been mining at this difficulty. This will yield, on average, one block every ten minutes.
As more miners join, the rate of block creation will go up. As the rate of block generation goes up, the difficulty rises to compensate which will push the rate of block creation back down. Any blocks released by malicious miners that do not meet the required difficulty target will simply be rejected by everyone on the network and thus will be worthless.
The Block Reward
When a block is discovered, the discoverer may award themselves a certain number of bitcoins, which is agreed-upon by everyone in the network. Currently this bounty is 25 bitcoins; this value will halve every 210,000 blocks. See Controlled Currency Supply.
Additionally, the miner is awarded the fees paid by users sending transactions. The fee is an incentive for the miner to include the transaction in their block. In the future, as the number of new bitcoins miners are allowed to create in each block dwindles, the fees will make up a much more important percentage of mining income.},

  shorttitle = {Majority {{Is Not Enough}}},
  abstract = {The Bitcoin cryptocurrency records its transactions in a public log called the blockchain. Its security rests critically on the distributed protocol that maintains the blockchain, run by participants called miners. Conventional wisdom asserts that the mining protocol is incentive-compatible and secure against colluding minority groups, that is, it incentivizes miners to follow the protocol as prescribed. We show that the Bitcoin mining protocol is not incentive-compatible. We present an attack with which colluding miners obtain a revenue larger than their fair share. This attack can have significant consequences for Bitcoin: Rational miners will prefer to join the selfish miners, and the colluding group will increase in size until it becomes a majority. At this point, the Bitcoin system ceases to be a decentralized currency. Unless certain assumptions are made, selfish mining may be feasible for any group size of colluding miners. We propose a practical modification to the Bitcoin protocol that protects Bitcoin in the general case. It prohibits selfish mining by pools that command less than 1/41/41/4 of the resources. This threshold is lower than the wrongly assumed 1/21/21/2 bound, but better than the current reality where a group of any size can compromise the system.},

  issn = {0006-3002},
  abstract = {1. The pH dependencies of the apparent Michaelis constant for oxidized glutathione and the apparent turnover number of yeast glutathione reductase (EC 1.6.4.2) have been determined at a fixed concentration of 0.1 mM NADPH in the range pH 4.5--8.0. Between pH 5.5 and 7.6, both of these parameters are relatively constant. The principal effect of low pH on the kinetics of the enzyme-catalyzed reaction is the observation of a pH-dependent substrate inhibition by oxidized glutathione at pH less than or equal 7, which is shown to correlate with the binding of oxidized glutathione to the oxidized form of the enzyme. 2. The catalytic activity of yeast glutathione reductase at pH 5.5 is affected by the sodium acetate buffer concentration. The stability of the oxidized and reduced forms of the enzyme at pH 5.5 and 25 degrees C in the absence of bovine serum albumin was studied as a function of sodium acetate concentration. The results show that activation of the catalytic activity of the enzyme at low sodium acetate concentration correlates with an effect of sodium acetate on a reduced form of the enzyme. In contrast, inhibition of the catalytic activity of the enzyme at high sodium acetate concentration correlates with an effect of sodium acetate on the oxidized form of the enzyme.},

  title = {Effect of Sodium Nitrate Loading on Electrolyte Transport by the Renal Tubule},
  volume = {229},
  issn = {0002-9513},
  abstract = {Effects of sodium nitrate were compared with sodium chloride loading on transport of electrolytes by the nephron. Maximal levels of free water clearance/clomerular filtration rate (CH2O/GFR) averaged 8.4\% with nitrate loading and 14.4\% with saline loading. Since ethacrynic acid and chlorothiazide exert their major natriuretic effect in the distal nephron, the increment in Na ad Cl reabsorbed beyond the proximal tubule. The administration of these agents resulted in an increase in fractional sodium excretion (CNa/GFR) of 21.1\%, urinary sodium excretion (UNaV) of 1,126 mueq/min, and urinary chloride excretion (UClV) of 848 mueq/min during nitrate loading compared with an increase in CNa/GFR of 37.6\%, UNaV of 2,362 mueq/min, and UClV of 2,397 mueq/min during saline loading. The smaller diuretic-induced increment in Na and Cl excretion in the nitrate studies suggests, as do the hydrated studies, that less Cl and Na are reabsorbed in the distal nephron during nitrate than saline loading. At every level of UNaV, fractional bicarbonate reabsorption was higher, urine pH was lower, and urinary potassium excretion (UKV) was higher in the nitrate studies. Thus, compared with saline loading, sodium nitrate decreases chloride and sodium reabsorption in the distal nephron. The higher hydrogen and potassium secretion in the nitrate studies may be consequent to the decreased ability of the distal nephron to reabsorb chloride.},

  title = {Sovereignty in {{Theory}} and {{Practice}}},
  url = {http://scholarship.law.ufl.edu/facultypub/293},
  abstract = {Our study moves into the sovereignty idea in the context of international law with reference to the work of Grotius, the Dutch international lawyer of the early 17th century. Grotius took the sovereignty discourse to another level by considering the problem of sovereignty in an environment of multiple sovereigns. This was an environment, which required law and legal skills and therefore provided a framework within which reasoned legal elaboration would provide a mechanism to coordinate sovereign relations and thereby provide international restraints on sovereign absolutism. The Article then considers a significant 17th century juridical event in the practice of international law. We refer to the Treaty of Westphalia (1648) and its relevance to the development of sovereignty in practice. The importance of the Treaty is that it juridicalized the idea of an international society based on sovereign nation States. It is a framework that has had incredible traction over time, and was reflected in the most powerful theories of international law founded on the nation-state participants. The Article then reviews the work of other international scholars and philosophers from Pufendorf to Austin. These early international lawyers grapple with the idea of sovereignty and the subordination of sovereignty to the idea of international obligation. Their work begins to show the influence of positivism and the development of international law based on empirical sources such as treaty and custom. These developments are then confronted with a new and rigorous jurisprudential theory of sovereignty developed by the English legal philosopher, John Austin. Austin developed the theory of sovereignty of considerable power and durability and modified versions of his idea of sovereignty continue to be important in international law and international relations today.},

This book takes you beyond the currency ("Blockchain 1.0") and smart contracts ("Blockchain 2.0") to demonstrate how the blockchain is in position to become the fifth disruptive computing paradigm after mainframes, PCs, the Internet, and mobile/social networking.Author Melanie Swan, Founder of the Institute for Blockchain Studies, explains that the blockchain is essentially a public ledger with potential as a worldwide, decentralized record for the registration, inventory, and transfer of all assets—not just finances, but property and intangible assets such as votes, software, health data, and ideas.Topics include:Concepts, features, and functionality of Bitcoin and the blockchainUsing the blockchain for automated tracking of all digital endeavorsEnabling censorship?resistant organizational modelsCreating a decentralized digital repository to verify identityPossibility of cheaper, more efficient services traditionally provided by nationsBlockchain for science: making better use of the data-mining networkPersonal health record storage, including access to one’s own genomic dataOpen access academic publishing on the blockchainThis book is part of an ongoing O’Reilly series. Mastering Bitcoin: Unlocking Digital Crypto-Currencies introduces Bitcoin and describes the technology behind Bitcoin and the blockchain. Blockchain: Blueprint for a New Economy considers theoretical, philosophical, and societal impact of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies.},

  abstract = {The aim of this paper is to make the case that peer production offers a unique chance to transcend capitalism, and that peer-to-peer movements represent the succession of industrial-society based socialisms. The paper describes the salient characteristics of peer production before going on to explore whether it is ‘transcendent’ or ‘immanent’ to the market system, concluding that it is both in that it creates a new form of capitalism and also points out how that new form might be overcome. Following a review of the hybrid economic forms emerging today, I formulate the hypothesis that peer production is actually a hyperproductive mode, forcing for-profit entities to adapt to its characteristics, thereby further integrating it into the existing political economy, but not without the transformative effects of its market transcending aspects. After examining the possible expansion of peer-production modalities to physical manufacturing, I also examine the class aspects of commons and sharing-based platforms and hypothesise the emergence of a new section of capital, netarchical capitalists, who enable and empower participation, but also monetise it and attempt to control it.},

  title = {Dunbar's Number},
  url = {https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dunbar%27s_number&oldid=807620488},
  abstract = {Dunbar's number is a suggested cognitive limit to the number of people with whom one can maintain stable social relationships—relationships in which an individual knows who each person is and how each person relates to every other person. This number was first proposed in the 1990s by British anthropologist Robin Dunbar, who found a correlation between primate brain size and average social group size. By using the average human brain size and extrapolating from the results of primates, he proposed that humans can comfortably maintain only 150 stable relationships. Dunbar explained it informally as "the number of people you would not feel embarrassed about joining uninvited for a drink if you happened to bump into them in a bar".
Proponents assert that numbers larger than this generally require more restrictive rules, laws, and enforced norms to maintain a stable, cohesive group. It has been proposed to lie between 100 and 250, with a commonly used value of 150. Dunbar's number states the number of people one knows and keeps social contact with, and it does not include the number of people known personally with a ceased social relationship, nor people just generally known with a lack of persistent social relationship, a number which might be much higher and likely depends on long-term memory size.
Dunbar theorized that "this limit is a direct function of relative neocortex size, and that this in turn limits group size [...] the limit imposed by neocortical processing capacity is simply on the number of individuals with whom a stable inter-personal relationship can be maintained". On the periphery, the number also includes past colleagues, such as high school friends, with whom a person would want to reacquaint himself or herself if they met again.},

  abstract = {Similarity breeds connection. This principle—the homophily principle—structures network ties of every type, including marriage, friendship, work, advice, support, information transfer, exchange, comembership, and other types of relationship. The result is that people's personal networks are homogeneous with regard to many sociodemographic, behavioral, and intrapersonal characteristics. Homophily limits people's social worlds in a way that has powerful implications for the information they receive, the attitudes they form, and the interactions they experience. Homophily in race and ethnicity creates the strongest divides in our personal environments, with age, religion, education, occupation, and gender following in roughly that order. Geographic propinquity, families, organizations, and isomorphic positions in social systems all create contexts in which homophilous relations form. Ties between nonsimilar individuals also dissolve at a higher rate, which sets the stage for the formation of niches (localized positions) within social space. We argue for more research on: (a) the basic ecological processes that link organizations, associations, cultural communities, social movements, and many other social forms; (b) the impact of multiplex ties on the patterns of homophily; and (c) the dynamics of network change over time through which networks and other social entities co-evolve.},

Both state control and privatization of resources have been advocated, but neither the state nor the market have been uniformly successful in solving common pool resource problems. After critiquing the foundations of policy analysis as applied to natural resources, Elinor Ostrom here provides a unique body of empirical data to explore conditions under which common pool resource problems have been satisfactorily or unsatisfactorily solved. Dr Ostrom uses institutional analysis to explore different ways - both successful and unsuccessful - of governing the commons. In contrast to the proposition of the 'tragedy of the commons' argument, common pool problems sometimes are solved by voluntary organizations rather than by a coercive state. Among the cases considered are communal tenure in meadows and forests, irrigation communities and other water rights, and fisheries--},

  abstract = {The ICT for development community has long searched for comprehensive and adequate conceptual frameworks. In 2003, the United Nations Regional Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (UN-ECLAC) proposed a three-dimensional conceptual framework that models the transition toward information societies as the interplay among technology, policy, and social change. It has its theoretical roots in Schumpeterian innovation theory. This so-called “cube framework” has been adopted on several occasions throughout the region at the local, national, and international levels. It has been employed in all stages of the policy cycle to identify areas and priorities for research and hands-on policy making (planning), to coordinate actors and stakeholders (execution), and to monitor progress toward information societies (evaluation). This article presents the framework and its particularities, reviews some of the diverse applications it has found during recent years, provides concrete suggestions on how it could be used in the future, and discusses its strengths and limitations. The cube is not a dynamic model that can make predictions, but it turns out to be useful as a conceptual framework; it can be used to structure the often-confused discussion about what is involved in the ongoing social transformation.},

  abstract = {The Archaeology of Knowledge (French: L'archéologie du savoir) is a 1969 methodological and historiographical treatise by the French philosopher Michel Foucault, in which he promotes "archaeology" or the "archaeological method", an analytical method he implicitly used in his previous works Madness and Civilization (1961), The Birth of the Clinic (1963), and The Order of Things (1966). It is Foucault's only explicitly methodological work.
Foucault's premise is that systems of thought and knowledge ("epistemes" or "discursive formations") are governed by rules (beyond those of grammar and logic) which operate beneath the consciousness of individual subjects and define a system of conceptual possibilities that determines the boundaries of thought and language use in a given domain and period. Foucault also provides a philosophical treatment and critique of phenomenological and dogmatic structural readings of history and philosophy, portraying continuous narratives as naïve ways of projecting our own consciousness onto the past, thus being exclusive and excluding.},

  title = {Public Sphere},
  url = {https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Public_sphere&oldid=799852491},
  abstract = {The public sphere (German Öffentlichkeit) is an area in social life where individuals can come together to freely discuss and identify societal problems, and through that discussion influence political action. The term was originally coined by German philosopher Jürgen Habermas who defined "the public sphere as a virtual or imaginary community which does not necessarily exist in any identifiable space". Communication scholar Gerard A. Hauser defines it as "a discursive space in which individuals and groups associate to discuss matters of mutual interest and, where possible, to reach a common judgment about them". The public sphere can be seen as "a theater in modern societies in which political participation is enacted through the medium of talk" and "a realm of social life in which public opinion can be formed".
Describing the emergence of the public sphere in the 18th century, Jürgen Habermas noted that the public realm, or sphere, originally was "coextensive with public authority", while "the private sphere comprised civil society in the narrower sense, that is to say, the realm of commodity exchange and of social labor". Whereas the "sphere of public authority" dealt with the state, or realm of the police, and the ruling class,or the feudal authorities (church, princes and nobility) the "authentic 'public sphere'", in a political sense, arose at that time from within the private realm, specifically, in connection with literary activities, the world of letters. This new public sphere spanned the public and the private realms, and "through the vehicle of public opinion it put the state in touch with the needs of society". "This area is conceptually distinct from the state: it [is] a site for the production and circulation of discourses that can in principle be critical of the state." The public sphere "is also distinct from the official economy; it is not an arena of market relations but rather one of the discursive relations, a theater for debating and deliberating rather than for buying and selling". These distinctions between "state apparatuses, economic markets, and democratic associations...are essential to democratic theory". The people themselves came to see the public sphere as a regulatory institution against the authority of the state. The study of the public sphere centers on the idea of participatory democracy, and how public opinion becomes political action.
The ideology of the public sphere theory is that the government's laws and policies should be steered by the public sphere and that the only legitimate governments are those that listen to the public sphere. "Democratic governance rests on the capacity of and opportunity for citizens to engage in enlightened debate". Much of the debate over the public sphere involves what is the basic theoretical structure of the public sphere, how information is deliberated in the public sphere, and what influence the public sphere has over society.},

Second, approaching the latter as a theoretical object, what might its core features comprise? And, third, is the British state acquiring these features? Arguments about these issues are often vague and, when taken together, frequently prove inconsistent. There is little agreement about the nature of Fordism and post-Fordism in general or the trajectories which might link them—let alone about the post-Fordist state in particular or the transitional regimes which might connect it to its putative Fordist precursor. Unless these problems are resolved, however, it would be premature to anticipate the core features of a post-Fordist welfare regime. Moreover, until these features are spelt out, if only in a preliminary manner, there can be no referent for assessing whether Britain has been moving towards some form of post-Fordist welfare state. It is these three issues in their interconnection that define my agenda here.},

  abstract = {Technocracy is a system of governance where decision-makers are selected on the basis of technological knowledge. Scientists, engineers, technologists, or experts in any field, would compose the governing body, instead of elected representatives. Leadership skills would be selected on the basis of specialized knowledge and performance, rather than parliamentary skills. Technocracy in that sense of the word (an entire government run as a technical or engineering problem) is mostly hypothetical. In another commonly used sense, technocracy is any portion of a bureaucracy that is run by technologists.
The term technocracy was originally used to advocate the application of the scientific method to solving social problems. Concern could be given to sustainability within the resource base, instead of monetary profitability, so as to ensure continued operation of all social-industrial functions. Some uses of the word refer to a form of meritocracy, where the ablest are in charge, ostensibly without the influence of special interest groups. The word technocratic has been used to describe governments that include non-elected professionals installed at a ministerial level.},

The active medium component is sensitive to protease treatment, indicating that it is a protein, but it is heat stable. Conditioned medium from HL-60 cells grown on protease-treated bone marrow matrix still contains the active component. Thus, it appears that the differentiation-inducing protein is produced by HL-60 cells and is not released from the bone marrow matrix. To identify this differentiation factor, RNA was isolated from HL-60 cells grown on bone marrow matrix and assayed by Northern analysis for expression of mRNA for human differentiation factor, tumor necrosis factor, and macrophage colony-stimulating factor, all inducers of monocyte/macrophage differentiation. Expression of differentiation factor, tumor necrosis factor, or macrophage colony-stimulating factor mRNA was not enhanced in HL-60 cells grown on matrix compared to cells grown on uncoated plastic flasks. Thus, the maturation factor does not appear to be differentiation factor, tumor necrosis factor, or macrophage colony-stimulating factor within the limits of detection of Northern analysis. Elution of the active conditioned medium fraction on a Sephacryl S-200 column revealed a molecular weight of approximately 40,000. The active protein eluted on a DEAE-cellulose ion-exchange column at an ionic strength of 0.3 M NaCl, indicating that it is fairly anionic.
