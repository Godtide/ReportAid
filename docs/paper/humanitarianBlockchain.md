## Abstract

This article describes a blockchain-based application for increasing the transparency of humanitarian financing. At the 2016 World Humanitarian Summit in Istanbul, humanitarian organisations made a 'Grand Bargain' to publish timely and transparent information about their funding - the summit proposed meeting the requirements of that bargain through a financial tracking system that satisfied the _3Ts_ of transparency, namely traceability, totality and timeliness. Aid organisations have been investigating direct delivery of aid through blockchains, but there appears very little research, if any, into the use of blockchains to improve the transparency of their aid reporting. This paper fills that gap when discussing a prototype application that uses blockchains for aid reporting. It argues that blockchains include mechanisms ideally suited to meet the Grand Bargain's _3Ts_ while adding a fourth - trust. This paper describes the prototype by showing how it might have been employed to report on the European Commission's 2015 response to the Ebola crisis in West Africa. The hope is that, ultimately, this paper, and the software it describes, leads to the deployment of a blockchain-based humanitarian aid reporting system that helps the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs increase the transparency of humanitarian aid.

## Introduction

In her 2015 book about the promise of blockchain technology, Swan wrote that blockchains could usher in an era that revolutionises all aspects of society [@Swan_BlockchainBlueprintNew_2015]. She saw its potential for transforming not just the economy, but also political, social and scientific domains. She defined such potential as Blockchain 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0, where 1.0 represents cryptocurrencies, 2.0 represents financial applications, and 3.0 represents applications beyond finance. This paper examines a blockchain 3.0 application for humanitarian aid reporting, which, at the time of writing, is called [ReportAid](https://github.com/glowkeeper/ReportAid) [^1]. Coppi says, "few advanced use cases of blockchain exist in the humanitarian sector. Instead, much discussion relates to potential and anticipated uses of the technology" [@Coppi_BlockchainDistributedLedger_2019]. [ReportAid](https://github.com/glowkeeper/ReportAid) is a proof of concept that attempts to fill that gap.

First, this paper describes the capabilities of blockchains that make it ideally suited as a technology for reporting on charitable finance. Then the paper introduces the International Aid Transparency Initiative, which is the United Nation's open standard for documenting mutual aid [@DevelopmentInitiatives_BaselineReportImplementing_2017]. Then the paper focuses on the design of [ReportAid](https://github.com/glowkeeper/ReportAid), which is a blockchain implementation of that standard. Afterwards, the paper creates an imagined scenario where [ReportAid](https://github.com/glowkeeper/ReportAid) documents the European Commission's 2015 response to the Ebola crisis in West Africa. Finally, the paper analyses the benefits that blockchains bring to that imagined scenario before discussing the application's limitations and proposals for future work.

## Blockchains

The overarching purpose of a blockchain is to become a public asset ledger of everything ever recorded, such that a network of multiple sites, geographies or institutions can share, inspect and create new records.

Blockchains came into being as the result of Satoshi Nakamoto's white paper on Bitcoin (BTC) [@Nakamoto_BitcoinPeertoPeerElectronic_2008]. Nakamoto described a form of electronic cash that relies on a distributed peer-to-peer (P2P) network. P2P is a system of nodes that have direct access to one another when acting as both providers and requesters that connect and collaborate [@Graham_FirstInternationalConference_2002]. A P2P network is often _decentralised_ because geographically diverse and autonomous entities form it. Bitcoin is _distributed_ because it is a decentralised system that is logically centralised since it behaves as a single coherent entity where users interact with it in a manner that is entirely consistent and uniform [@Tanenbaum_DistributedSystemsPrinciples_2007].

In a distributed system that consists of many computing nodes, any of which could be unreliable, it is a challenge to reach an agreement, such that the system as a whole maintains consistency. It is a conundrum known as the Byzantine Generals Problem because an archaic battlefield analogy describes it succinctly. Loyal generals of the Byzantine army, camped with their troops around an enemy city, must reach agreement on a battle strategy. Unfortunately, one or more of the generals are traitors that attempt to subvert the plan; under those circumstances, how do the loyal generals ensure the Byzantine effort is successful? The solution for distributed computing is to use a consensus protocol that is a global agreement between many, distrusting, anonymous parties [@AndrewPoelstra_StakeConsensus_2015], such that nodes on a distributed network can decide on a fault-tolerant state of the system. Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) systems must be dependable, even under the circumstances where individual components have failed or where there is imperfect information available. Lamport gave a theoretical solution, via a distributed consensus scheme, in his 1982 paper [@leslie_lamport_byzantine_1982], where he shows that the problem is solvable if and only if more than two-thirds of the generals are loyal. However, Nakamoto's BTC implementation was the first computing application to provide production-ready BFT consensus.

Bitcoin is referred to as cryptocurrency because it is a form of electronic currency that is reliant on cryptographic techniques; primarily, data encryption, public-key cryptography (PKC) and digital signatures. Data encryption is a process that encodes a message to produce ciphertext. It works by combining some text that must be kept a secret, with a much shorter key. Decryption is the act of transforming ciphertext back into the original message [@ethereum_ethereum_2016]. PKC is a form of encryption that creates a widely-shared public key, and a private key, which must be kept secret by the owner [@menezes_HandbookAppliedCryptography_1997]. The idea is simple - Alice wishes to send Bob a private message, so she uses Bob's public key to encrypt that message. Subsequently, only Bob can decrypt Alice's message since he is the only person who has the paired private key. Digital signatures allow Alice to prove her identity. They work by Alice producing a pair of signing and verification keys, the latter of which she publishes. Then, given a message that needs signing, Alice produces a signature, and the final text she sends Bob combines the original message with that signature [@menezes_HandbookAppliedCryptography_1997]. Bob then takes the message, the signature and Alice's verification key, and runs an algorithm that confirms it was Alice that signed the message because that signature relies on Alice's private key, which only she holds. [@AndrewPoelstra_StakeConsensus_2015].

Bitcoin's basic unit of account is called a Satoshi, named in homage to the technology's creator. They represent one hundred millionth, or 0.00000001, of a single Bitcoin. The overriding purpose of BTC is the propagation of transactions, which represent owners of Satoshi informing the network that they have transferred ownership elsewhere. Each transaction has at least one input and one output, whereby each input maps the Satoshi paid to previous outputs, and each new output becomes an unspent transaction output (UTXO). When a BTC address shows a balance of 100 Satoshi, it means that the address has 100 Satoshi in one or more UTXO [@Bitcoin_DeveloperGuideBitcoin_2018]. That UTXO maps an amount of Satoshi to a transaction output that contains instructions for their ongoing transfer - anyone who wishes to spend those Satoshi must be able to supply the private key that matches the corresponding public key detailed in the UTXO. Those new owners can, in turn, create another transaction that authorises the ongoing transfer. Thus, a chain of ownership is formed [@antonopoulos_mastering_2015]. Recording individual transactions on the network would be inefficient, so nodes on the BTC network package transactions into blocks, which contain a timestamp and a link to the previous block [@ethereum_ethereum_2016]. The network continually updates, producing roughly one block every ten minutes; over time, that creates a persistent, ever-growing, _blockchain_ that reflects the latest state of the Bitcoin ledger. The result is a transaction network that behaves similarly to individual lines in a double-entry bookkeeping ledger because they help determine balances within the BTC network [@Tschorsch_BitcoinTechnicalSurvey_2015]. Hence, the overriding purpose of the BTC network is the propagation of transactions, which exhibit the following qualities:

1. **Authorised**: Transactions are authorised so that only _user x_ can perform transactions under the guise of _user x_.
2. **Read-only and Final**: Transactions cannot be modified or deleted.
3. **Uncensored**:  A transaction is added to the ledger whenever it conforms to the Bitcoin protocol.
4. **Consistent**: Any transactions added to the ledger conforms to the present state of the system [@bitfury_group_public_2015].

The system described by Nakamoto is _trustless_, in as much as it decentralises authority because the network operates without needing to trust any single controlling entity or third-party financial institutions [@Nakamoto_BitcoinPeertoPeerElectronic_2008]. BTC achieves that through its BFT consensus process, whereby transaction validators are rewarded with Bitcoin when they win the right to add blocks of transactions to the network. Those validators win that right by solving a difficult cryptographic problem, a process called 'Proof of Work' (PoW) [@bitcoin_wiki_proof_2015]. Hence, it is the process by which the system brings new coins into existence, so it is figuratively known as _mining_.

PoW consensus relies on a game-theoretic _Nash Equilibrium_, whereby the most profitable operation for each miner is to act in consensus with the majority. That works due to a fundamental concept of BTC - the longest chain. If two versions of the next block on its blockchain are broadcast by different miners simultaneously, the network nodes verify a new block by accepting the earliest transaction. In that circumstance, the chain with the later transaction is reserved. When the next block is broadcast to the network, if the reserve chain becomes the longest branch, then the network nodes switch to that. In that case, the longest chain has expended the most significant amount of PoW, so as long as the majority of nodes on the network are honest, then the honest chain will grow faster than any competing chains. Hence, the majority decision on what constitutes an honest transaction is reached by consensus via the longest chain. Thus, the result is the system stabilises, since no participant gains by changing strategy from that which produces the longest chain [@AndrewPoelstra_StakeConsensus_2015].

PoW has other advantages, too, not least is that it requires nodes on the BTC network to perform some form of computational work to establish trusted identity. That gives the system a natural way of overcoming 'Sybil Attacks' [@marcin_andrychowicz_distributed_2014], which is where a single faulty entity can present multiple identities and thereby, it gains control of a substantial fraction of a system [@Douceur_SybilAttack_2002], which it could use for nefarious purposes.

Greenspan describes blockchains as a distributed multi-version concurrency control (MVCC) database: "with a few more bells and whistles" [@greenspan_ending_2015]. At first glance, the comparison to a database appears valid. First, the current set of UTXO forms the whole database, whereby each UTXO equates to a single row in a table. Secondly, one or more of those outputs creates one or more new outputs, which is much like a database transaction that deletes one or more rows and then creates one or more new rows. Thirdly, blockchains ensure a single output cannot be spent by more than one transaction, much like MVCC databases guard against the deletion of a single row by more than one transaction. Fourthly, the unit inputs to a transaction must cover the unit outputs, a rule that disallows transactions from increasing the number of units on the network. That is similar to a database stored procedure, except that it is impossible to circumvent. Hence, a blockchain is different from a traditional distributed database because they have many more capabilities. For instance, blockchains include exchange mechanisms that allow for the secure and seamless transfer of assets without relying upon any form of centralisation [@swan_blockchain:_2015]. Furthermore, blockchains use public-key cryptography to create UTXOs, which means, unlike any database, they include a publicly auditable UTXO permission scheme.

BTC is an open-source GitHub project [^2], and therefore, anyone is free to fork the code and create their implementation of its underlying blockchain technology. Indeed, since its launch in 2009, Bitcoin has spawned a group of alternative blockchains that use the same general approach. They have popularly became known as _altcoins_ [@guadamuz_blockchains_2015]; some of the more well-known examples are Litecoin, Ripple and Stellar. Perhaps the best known, however, is Ethereum, which was first proposed in a white paper by Vitalik Buterin [@ethereum_ethereum_2016]. The network went live on 30th July 2015. Ethereum has capabilities above and beyond Bitcoin because the platform enables Turing-complete application code, known as smart contracts.

The phrase 'smart contract' was first coined in 1994 by Nick Szabo [@Szabo_SmartContracts_1994]. Szabo considered a smart contract as an electronic transaction protocol that did not require trusted intermediaries for executing contractual arrangements, such as payments. Back then, Szabo considered some Point of Sale (POS) systems as having implemented limited smart contract functionality. Today, Ethereum uses a decentralised virtual environment, the Ethereum Virtual Machine, to provide a decentralised Turing-complete operating system that can run blockchain addressable scripts that represent verifiable application logic [@Huckle_SocialismBlockchain_2016]; in essence, those smart contracts are promises to provide some predefined functionality. That is an ability used by [ReportAid](https://github.com/glowkeeper/ReportAid), the application discussed later in this paper.

The result is that blockchains are ideally suited to applications whereby records need to be publicly auditable, such as humanitarian aid.

## The International Aid Transparency Initiative

The "Grand Bargain" (GB) made at the 2016 World Health Summit (WHS), committed to enhancing the transparency of humanitarian aid reporting [@WorldHumanitarianSummit_CommitmentsActionWorld_2016].

The amount of humanitarian financing contributed by the U.K. is a result of the official development assistance target of 0.7% of gross national income [@GOV.UK_OfficialDevelopmentAssistance_2018]. In 2015, that amounted to the U.K. spending £12.1bn [@Morris_RealityCheckHow_2017], a degree of funding that has received much criticism. For example, while giving evidence to a U.S. Senate Committee on foreign relations, ex-UK Prime Minister David Cameron suggested that much of the money goes to corrupt regimes, "If what we do is just have continued programs for countries that sometimes fail year after year after year, we just keep going, maybe that's not a good use of our money" [@MailOnline_StripAidMoney_2018].

There have been efforts to address such criticisms. The 2016 World Humanitarian Summit (WHS) described five 'commitments to action', which outline the critical responsibilities for aid:

1. Uphold the norms that safeguard humanity by enhancing compliance and accountability to international law.
2. Implement a new approach to forced displacement so that no one is left behind.
3. Achieve gender equality and greater inclusivity.
4. Instead of replacing local systems, reinforce them so that, eventually, there is no need for aid.
5. Invest in humanity by diversifying the resource base and increasing cost-efficiency [@WorldHumanitarianSummit_CommitmentsActionWorld_2016].

The WHS described those five critical responsibilities as an 'Agenda for Humanity' [^3], whose aim was to transform the lives of 130 million people living in crisis-affected areas around the world  @WorldHumanitarianSummit_CommitmentsActionWorld_2016]. As a result, large humanitarian donors and aid organisations agreed to a "Grand Bargain" (GB) to improve the lives of people living in fragile situations because of crises [@WorldHumanitarianSummit_CommitmentsActionWorld_2016]. The GB made many commitments, including enhancing the transparency of mutual aid reporting, thereby strengthening accountability, helping decision-making and ultimately, improving the effectiveness of humanitarian efforts. The Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC), a forum that was founded by UN and non-UN humanitarian partners in 1992 to strengthen mutual assistance, formed a 'workstream' to carry out the GB's transparency commitment [^4]. The workstream's baseline report acknowledged that, while more information on aid funding had become available, there was still a need for more organisations to produce better quality humanitarian data [@DevelopmentInitiatives_BaselineReportImplementing_2017].

Consequently, the United Nation's adopted the International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI) as its standard open-data format for documenting aid finance [@DevelopmentInitiatives_BaselineReportImplementing_2017]. Established in 2008, IATI became part of the movement for improving the reporting of charitable actions. Then, in 2013, various bodies of the United Nations (UN) began hosting IATI [@DevelopmentInitiatives_ImprovingHumanitarianTransparency_2017], after which it became the international framework for publishing open data on development cooperation and humanitarian assistance [@DevelopmentInitiatives_BaselineReportImplementing_2017]. Indeed, as of January 2017, over 500 humanitarian organisations are using IATI, including the governments of Japan, Sweden, the U.K. and the U.S., the European Commission's Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection department, Oxfam, Save the Children, UNICEF and the World Food Programme [@DevelopmentInitiatives_ImprovingHumanitarianTransparency_2017].

The IASC's GB workstream identified the Financial Tracking Service (FTS) of the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), as the humanitarian reporting platform where IATI data from different organisations, and various platforms, could be amalgamated and published for analysis by global actors [@DevelopmentInitiatives_ImprovingHumanitarianTransparency_2017]. The FTS came into being in 1992 as a result of a set of guiding principles for strengthening the coordination of humanitarian emergency assistance under U.N. General Assembly Resolution 46/182 [^5]. As of the end of 2016, three hundred and fifty humanitarian organisations reported financial information to FTS, including all significant government donors, all U.N. humanitarian agencies, Red Cross organisations, as well as 250 NGOs and private organisations [@DevelopmentInitiatives_ImprovingHumanitarianTransparency_2017]. FTS can import the latest versions of the IATI standard; thus IATI complements FTS by providing the technical publishing framework by which FTS can make available structured reports on aid efforts.

This paper examines whether blockchains have capabilities that can enhance the FTS and add further succour to the transparency initiative of the WHS. It does so through [ReportAid](https://github.com/glowkeeper/ReportAid), a blockchain-based application that implements IATA on the blockchain.

## Application Design

The IATI open data standard defines specific entities that need recording. Figure 1, below, shows [ReportAid](https://github.com/glowkeeper/ReportAid) as a blockchain-based application that allows users to input, amend, and read IATA standard organisation and activity records. Hence, [ReportAid](https://github.com/glowkeeper/ReportAid) is a blockchain-based proof of concept that represents an implementation of OCHA's FTS.

![Figure 1: A Use Case Diagram for ReportAid](images/useCaseDiagram.png)

Figure 2, below, shows the [ReportAid](https://github.com/glowkeeper/ReportAid) smart contract implementation of the IATI organisations standard. That standard describes planned future budget information for aid funding [^6]. Described is a top-level IATIOrganisations element (this contains information such as the generation date of the report), which has at least one IATIOrganisation element (containing the report's language and currency type). That IATIOrganisation element links to other information describing the aid, such as the reporting organisation, associated country budgets and any supporting documentation.

![Figure 2: IATI Organisations Smart Contracts](images/organisationsClassDiagram.png)

Figure 3, below, shows the [ReportAid](https://github.com/glowkeeper/ReportAid) smart contract implementation of the IATI activities standard. A large number of fields describe IATI activities, and [ReportAid](https://github.com/glowkeeper/ReportAid), at the time of writing, has not implemented all of those; however, it does support all the mandatory fields, as well as one or two that are recommended [^7]. Figure 3 shows a top-level IATIActivies element (which contains information such as the generation date of the report). That features at least one IATIActivity element (containing information such as the default currency type and the degree to which the activity relates to humanitarian aid), which links to information such as the organisation participating in the activity, the sector and territory to which the activity belongs, as well as budgetary data. A single reporting organisation produces an activity report.

![Figure 3: IATI Activities Smart Contracts](images/activitiesClassDiagram.png)

## The European Commission's West African Response to Ebola

The baseline report of the IASC GB transparency workstream cites the recent Ebola crises as an example of incomplete, inaccurate, inconsistent and often inaccessible information that impacted the humanitarian effort in the diseases' epicentre in West-Africa [@DevelopmentInitiatives_ImprovingHumanitarianTransparency_2017]. Indeed, the report says that the lack of an adequately planned response hindered attempts to alleviate the outbreak because, at the time, no donor, government or aid agency was able to gain an overarching overview of available resources. The suggestion is that, were all the Ebola humanitarian aid efforts documented using the IATI standard and published to the UN's FTS, organisations would have had a more accurate picture of what was needed, thus improving the effectiveness of their response.

Despite such shortcomings, many of the organisations that are already using IATI make information about their development contributions available through existing aid information portals; a widely-used example is an open-source platform called [d-portal](http://d-portal.org/) [^8]. That includes several IATI activities related to the world's response to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. Hence, it contains data that [ReportAid](https://github.com/glowkeeper/ReportAid) can import, thereby demonstrating its suitability as a proof of concept for blockchain-based humanitarian aid reporting. One such activity documented on [d-portal](http://d-portal.org) was that carried out by the European Commission's Directorate-General for International Cooperation and Development (DEVCO), titled "A West African Response to Ebola" (AWARE), with IATI activity identifier XI-IATI-EC_DEVCO-2014/37785/0. That had a planned start date of 15th December 2015 and planned end date of 27th November 2018. The commitments of the activity totalled US$39,957,400. Its overall objective was to mitigate the harmful effects of the diseases' outbreak. Additionally, it was to contribute to the recovery of the most affected countries. Its specific purpose was to increase awareness of the diseases' symptoms and strengthen the resilience of primary healthcare systems. [Appendix A](./appendixAWAREXML.md) includes the XML describing AWARE.

Figure 4, below, shows [ReportAid](https://github.com/glowkeeper/ReportAid) creating the organisation record for AWARE.  

![Figure 4: Creating the organisation record for DEVCO](images/devcoOrgRecord.png)

The smart contract implementation of IATI Activities depends on a single top-level activities record. [ReportAid](https://github.com/glowkeeper/ReportAid) must create that before it can record any specific activity. Figure 7.5, below, shows [ReportAid](https://github.com/glowkeeper/ReportAid) using MetaMask to sign the transaction creating the necessary top-level activities record [^705].

![Figure 5: Creating the overarching activities record for the DEVCO Ebola activity](images/devcoActivitiesRecord.png)

Figure 7.6, below, shows [ReportAid](https://github.com/glowkeeper/ReportAid) signing the transaction creating the activity relating to AWARE.

![Figure 6: Creating the activity record for DEVCO's AWARE activity](images/devcoActivityRecord.png)

Subsequently, anyone can read that activity record. Furthermore, that data can be trusted because the transaction that created that record was digitally signed. Figure 7, below, shows [ReportAid](https://github.com/glowkeeper/ReportAid) retrieving the information created in Figure 7.6.

![Figure 7: Reading the activity record for DEVCO's AWARE activity](images/devcoReadActivityRecord.png)

The AWARE activity had a planned start date of 15th December 2015, an actual start date of 9th March 2015 and a planned end date of 27th November 2018. Figure 8, below, shows [ReportAid](https://github.com/glowkeeper/ReportAid) recording the planned start date.

![Figure 8: Creating the planned start date for DEVCO's AWARE activity](images/devcoPlannedStartDate.png)

Figure 9, below, shows [ReportAid](https://github.com/glowkeeper/ReportAid) subsequently retrieving those dates.

![Figure 9: Retrieving the activity dates for DEVCO's AWARE activity](images/devcoReadActivityDates.png)

Figure 10, below, shows [ReportAid](https://github.com/glowkeeper/ReportAid) recording AWARE's budget commitment of  US$28,000,000.

![Figure 10: Recording the primary transaction record of DEVCO's AWARE activity](images/devcoTransaction.png)

Figure 11, below, shows [ReportAid](https://github.com/glowkeeper/ReportAid) subsequently retrieving that record.

![Figure 11:  Retrieving the primary transaction of DEVCO's AWARE activity](images/devcoReadTransaction.png)

The AWARE activity recorded on [d-portal](http://d-portal.org) contains more information, such as other budgetary disbursements, administrative contact information and links to other activities related to AWARE. At the time of writing, [ReportAid](https://github.com/glowkeeper/ReportAid) was able to model most of that data, however showing that here would add little to the discussion.

## Discussion

The example above, which shows [ReportAid](https://github.com/glowkeeper/ReportAid) recording the the European Commission's 2015 response to the Ebola crisis in West Africa, suggests blockchains, through implementing the IATI standard, can address criticisms of humanitarian aid, such as those made by ex-UK Prime Minister David Cameron while giving evidence to a U.S. Senate Committee on foreign relations [@MailOnline_StripAidMoney_2018].

Even before the Grand Bargain made at the 2016 World Health Summit, the Inter-Agency Standing Committee, a forum that was founded by UN and non-UN humanitarian partners in 1992 to strengthen mutual assistance, had formed a Humanitarian Financing Task Team (HFTT) [^9], tasked with researching financial transparency. They believed that helped fight corruption by providing the keys to understand, "why, how, what, and how much" [@TransparencyInternational_WhatCorruption_2018]. The HFTT defined the '3Ts' of transparent reporting:

1. **Traceability**. The entire transaction chain of aid data must be traceable.
2. **Totality**. Financial information must be complete and relevant.
3. **Timeliness**. Aid information should be up-to-date [@DevelopmentInitiatives_ImprovingHumanitarianTransparency_2017].

The mechanisms of blockchains, described earlier, address those '3Ts' of transparent reporting. First, blockchains satisfy the traceability criteria because its records are publicly viewable and all transactions created are traceable algorithmically [@Savelyev_CopyrightBlockchainEra_2018]. Secondly, they meet the totality criteria because its records are practically impossible to change and the present state of the blockchain is a deterministic function of the genesis block and its ensuing transaction history [@Ethereum_ShardingFAQs_2018]. In other words, a blockchain represents a historical record of all transactions ever recorded on their network. Thirdly, they fulfil the timeliness criteria because all records are timestamped. Therefore, anyone viewing the records can see just how timely they are.

However, might the HFTT have missed a 'T', namely, trust? Trust is the glue binding society together because it gives us confidence in situations that might otherwise harbour unknown risks [@Botsman_WhoCanYou_2018]. Society does not necessarily achieve prosperity as the result of an abundance of natural resources or brilliance of intellect. Neither is that an inevitable result of systemic ideologies, such as frictionless free markets or the communitarian approach of commons-based peer production. Those things may have an important role to play, but ultimately, prosperity, in any form, comes as a result of "spontaneous sociability", achieved through trust because that is the crucial ingredient of any relationship and healthy relationships lead to success [@Fukuyama_TrustSocialVirtues_1996]. As was shown above, a blockchain's decentralised exchange mechanisms go above and beyond a traditional distributed database because they use public-key cryptography to create records, which means, unlike any database, they include a publicly auditable permission scheme. Blockchains have capabilities resulting in their suitability for determining integrity and authenticity because they are a cryptographically secured immutable database technology with: "with a few more bells and whistles" [@greenspan_ending_2015].  In essence, blockchains have inbuilt trust mechanisms [@Huckle_FakeNewsTechnological_2017]. Hence, [ReportAid](https://github.com/glowkeeper/ReportAid) is an example of an application for humanitarian aid reporting that, by using blockchains, adds that vital ingredient of trust. For example, when an aid organisation adds a record to its implementation of the IATI standard, users can trust that it is that organisation that has created that record because they have digitally signed the transaction that did so.

## Limitations and Future Work

The WHS recognised that OCHA's FTS needed enhancing [@UNOfficefortheCoordinationofHumanitarian_ImprovingHumanitarianTransparency_2017], and this paper proposes [ReportAid](https://github.com/glowkeeper/ReportAid), as a blockchain implementation of IATI that adds trust to the traceability of humanitarian aid reporting, might be one such enhancement. However, there are significant barriers that might prevent the uptake of blockchain-based technology, such as [ReportAid](https://github.com/glowkeeper/ReportAid):

1. **Technological**. Aid organisations using [ReportAid](https://github.com/glowkeeper/ReportAid) would have to get used to new technology, whereas traditional databases have been around much longer and are, therefore, much better understood. There is likely to be pushback from IT departments too, because blockchains could, potentially, make them redundant.

2. **Organisational**. Public blockchains are inherently non-hierarchical, so they cannot be controlled by any single entity [@Huckle_FakeNewsTechnological_2017]. However, the FTS is a reporting platform run by OCHA. Hence, a fully-public blockchain-based system may challenge centralised, top-down governance and related assumptions the UN have about reporting on their aid funding.

3. **Cost**. Even though [ReportAid](https://github.com/glowkeeper/ReportAid) is a working prototype of a blockchain-based implementation of IATI, were OCHA to invest in the technology, it may incur significant upfront costs, including those required for development, training and software maintenance. However, by replacing a traditional database architecture with a public blockchain, OCHA (and any organisation using the technology) may make significant long-term cost savings on infrastructure.

As well as barriers to uptake, the current version of [ReportAid](https://github.com/glowkeeper/ReportAid) is prototype software, so, at the time of writing, it is limited in several regards and therefore, future iterations of the application should address those limitations. For example, it has not yet implemented all of the IATI organisation and activity records, so its coverage of the IATI standard needs completing. [ReportAid](https://github.com/glowkeeper/ReportAid) only displays the very latest records for a particular organisation or activity; however, all iterations of that record exist on the blockchain so it could display those. Additionally, the reporting function of [ReportAid](https://github.com/glowkeeper/ReportAid) currently outputs simple text records to the screen. A future release of the application should output XML that conforms to the IATI standard.

## Conclusion

This paper discusses [ReportAid](https://github.com/glowkeeper/ReportAid), which is a blockchain-based application for implementing the IATI standard for humanitarian aid reporting. That paper gave some background to IATI and described the functionality of blockchains that make it an ideal tool for implementing that standard, which it showed by way of an imagined scenario where the application is used to document the European Commission's response to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. That example shows how [ReportAid](https://github.com/glowkeeper/ReportAid) helps address criticism of humanitarian aid by providing the mechanisms for the _4Ts_ of transparent humanitarian aid reporting, namely:

1. **Traceability**
2. **Totality**
3. **Timeliness**
4. **Trustworthiness**

Finally, this paper proposes a test pilot of [ReportAid](https://github.com/glowkeeper/ReportAid). That might help address the technological obstacles and challenge organisational concerns, discussed above. A pilot scheme would also aid a greater understanding of the technology and should help unearth any additional hurdles to overcome. Were that to happen, [ReportAid](https://github.com/glowkeeper/ReportAid), as a unique and advanced humanitarian use-case of blockchains, would help realise some of Coppi's supposed potential of blockchain technology [@Coppi_BlockchainDistributedLedger_2019].
