## Abstract

This article describes a blockchain-based application for increasing the transparency of humanitarian financing. At the 2016 World Humanitarian Summit in Istanbul, humanitarian organisations made a 'Grand Bargain' to publish timely and transparent information about their funding - the summit proposed meeting the requirements of that bargain through a financial tracking system that satisfied the '3Ts' of transparency, namely traceability, totality and timeliness. Aid organisations have been investigating direct delivery of aid through blockchains, but there appears very little research, if any, into the use of blockchains to improve the transparency of their aid reporting. This paper fills that gap when discussing a prototype application that uses blockchains for aid reporting. It argues that blockchains include mechanisms ideally suited to meet the Grand Bargain's '3Ts', while adding a fourth - trust. This paper describes the prototype by showing how it might have been employed to report on the European Commission's 2015 response to the Ebola crisis in West Africa. The hope is that, ultimately, this paper, and the software it describes, leads to the deployment of a blockchain-based humanitarian aid reporting system that helps the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs increase the transparency of humanitarian aid.
