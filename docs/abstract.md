# Abstract

Might blockchain applications offer a solution to problems of distributing aid in refugee camps while also identifying those receiving that aid? Organisations working in such camps often have difficulties securely distributing aid efficiently and effectively.  Could the secure, transparent mechanisms of blockchains have a role there? Might they offer a solution to distributing food directly to the neediest?  Moreover, could blockchains also provide a means of identifying the neediest? While organisations such as the UN, Unicef and the World Food Program are considering uses of blockchains in aid situations, none of them has yet considered the technology as an integrated whole that both distributes aid and provides an identity to those receiving aid. This article discusses some scenarios in which blockchains may be useful. Through developing those scenarios, we arrive at a possible technological solution to both the problem of aid distribution and refugee identity. Furthermore, we create an early prototype of that solution to show what is possible. We hope this research provides a key driver for the humanitarian organisations to consider how and why they may use blockchains in refugee situations.
