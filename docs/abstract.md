# Abstract

We propose that blockchain technology can help improve the accountability of international state aid provided through official development assistance (ODA) targets set by the UN. The ODA target is 0.7% of gross national income (GNI), but very few countries meet that figure, and even some of those that do are pressurised to reduce the amount given from politicians, media and sections of the public. Amongst criticisms are that the enormous sums involved are susceptible to fraud. While humanitarian organisations are researching the deployment of technologies, such as blockchains, to deliver aid to those in need, there is very little research into how to use that technology in the delivery of State aid, so that it helps address the concerns over corruption. In this paper, we develop a prototype of just such a system, based on blockchain technology, that humanitarian organisations could use to help increase their accountability. In developing the prototype, we first describe the problem in detail and then look at commercial supply chain solutions based on blockchains. Then we adapted those solutions to the humanitarian sphere and created a novel application that organisations could use to help increase their accountability and thereby address criticisms surrounding fraud. We hope that the software we propose will form the basis of further research and the deployment of humanitarian aid traceability systems that will help organisations fend of criticisms regarding how they use the money provided through state aid via the ODA.
