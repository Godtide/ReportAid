# Abstract

Might blockchain applications offer a solution to the problems of both aid distribution and identifying those receiving that aid? Humanitarian organisations often have difficulties distributing aid securely and efficiently. Could the secure, transparent mechanisms of blockchains help distribute support directly to the neediest? Moreover, could blockchains also provide a means of identifying the neediest? While organisations such as the UN, Unicef and the World Food Program are investigating uses of blockchains in aid situations, none of them has yet considered the technology as an integrated whole that both helps distribute aid and provides identification to those receiving aid. This article discusses some scenarios in which blockchains may be useful. Through developing those scenarios, we arrive at a possible technological solution to both the problem of aid distribution and the identification of those needing aid. Furthermore, we create an early prototype of that solution to show what is possible. We hope this research provides a key driver for the humanitarian organisations to consider how and why they may use blockchains.
